This technology has the potential to enhance e-commerce experiences, drive revenue for businesses, and deepen consumer-brand relationships.\r\n\r\nThe session specifically examines three core use cases of blockchain and AI in e-commerce: commerce co-creation, proof of custody, and immersive e-commerce. Commerce co-creation allows brands to co-create new products and experiences with their consumers, while proof of custody ensures the authenticity and provenance of products. Immersive e-commerce uses virtual reality (VR) and augmented reality (AR) to create more engaging and interactive shopping experiences.\r\n\r\nThe use of blockchain and AI in e-commerce is still in its early stages, but it has the potential to fundamentally reshape the way we shop online. \r\n\r\nSome use cases discussed: \r\n\r\n1. Traditional e-commerce platforms are static and fail to engage online shoppers.\r\n2. Blockchain and AI can be used to create more personalized, interactive, and immersive e-commerce experiences.\r\n3. Commerce co-creation allows brands to co-create new products and experiences with their consumers.\r\n4.

Since then, we have built a digital art market that spans style, genre, geography, language, and more.

But in our recently launched v2, we take it one step further. We preserve that memoir on the blockchain and tie it to the NFT artwork. For the archeologists of the future, NFTs minted on our platform will not only tell the visual story of our times, but also have a written counterpart onchain. \r\n\r\n\r\nWe believe that this technology will help creators to preserve history and document the digital renaissance that we are witnessing before us today.","start":1694903400000,"end":1694905200000,"stageId":"michigan_stage__creatives__trad_business_","speakers":[{"id":"virginia_valenzuela","name":"Virginia Valenzuela","bio":"An award-winning arts writer with expertise in crypto journalism, web3 marketing, and community development, Virginia Valenzuela boasts over 6 years of experience managing editorial teams and contributors.
